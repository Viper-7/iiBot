Project Goals : To provide..
	developers with a quick & simple gateway for testing new code, unfamiliar functions, and general experimentation
	a teaching & collaboration aid to demonstrate and/or test code in a live, shared environment
	a simple method of developing that code into a reusable script that can be referenced to or expanded on later
	plain text access to existing code objects of any language via a minimalist script
	a facility for end users to run these scripts via 'friendly' methods (irc, webpage, web applets, local application)


Planned Commands: 	Webservice call, Rss fetch, Regexp, SQL Query (various dbs)
Planned Languages: 	Perl, ASP, Javascript, SQL, Lua, Compiled language support (C, Java, etc)

Todo : (current task list)
	system file execution protection
	system file read/write protection
	runaway process detection
	proper chroot support (but not relied upon)
	private message interface support (public)
	centralized configuration
	better language support
	fix the LOCKOUT_TIME hack


Future : (possiblities brainstorm)
	reorganize scripts folder to handle more languages in a logical way
	recode core logic in a 'real' language :P
	cross-platform support
	support calling scripts from scripts (cross-language)
	Microsoft .NET language support
	global user defined script includes
	user database with privileges & permissions
	use/encourage a more object-oriented approach in the user scripts
	standardized script format with automatic help and defined arguments (i'm thinking 1-2 optional comment lines at the start)
	secure web interface to manage scripts & configuration
	recode bot for different interfaces  - 	direct tcp socket
						execute from shell
						webserver (http://my.url/?cmd=whois&args=www.google.com)
						windows run dialog (via remote server)
						HTML clickable interface (connect a user script to a non-literate user)
	shared database for all languages & all scripts for user data (automatically connected before the script is run)
	More languages & scripts!
