				=============================


iiBot is a bash interface to the ii IRC client from http://www.suckless.org/programs/ii.html

This script was coded as a means for me and a few friends to learn more about a few languages,
including bash, php, ruby & python. The basic premise is quite simple; Drop a script into the 
scripts/user/<lang> folder in the language of your choice, and start using the command in IRC.

The interface is designed to facilitate rapid testing of code, in an environment as close to 
the natural language format as possible. Scripts placed in the <lang> folders are executed 
in exactly the same way a cgi webserver or crontab would. So the code you write will work as
it is, with no changes, on a live webserver. The modules created for this bot make perfect 
functions to drop straight into production systems.

There is no database used, instead a temp folder is specified in each channel's config. This 
folder is used to track a timestamp of when the a user last ran a command (for the spam filter),
and for some temp space for some of the more elaborate languages (ie brainfuck). This folder 
does not need to be unique, but it may help for busy channels. All configuration is done in the 
scripts in the channel folder. No other scripts should need to be changed.

All built-in commands are documented, type @help to get a list (dynamically updated) then type
a command with no parameters to check it's syntax. One of the only standards for scripts
written for the bot, is to display usage information if called with no parameters.

There are a few built in interpreters (@calc, @php, @ruby & @brainfuck), these will take one
line of standard code passed as a parameter. They always take care of any headers or opening
structures required, just run whatever function or code you want (ie: @php $a=1;$b=2;echo $a+$b)
The only caveat is all backslashes must be escaped, so you must double up any \'s in your code.
This does not affect scripts, only code typed through IRC.

You can also create scripts directly from IRC. Type @make<lang> <command> to start capturing
your text in the channel, into your new command. Finish with a # on an empty line. Scripts 
created in this manner must have all headers or opening tags included (ie <?php & ?>). The 
same rules apply for escaping \'s (Double them up).

I'll be adding more languages as I go, hopefully far far more than are currently supported.

Stay Tuned :)



===========================
== !! IMPORTANT NOTES !! ==
===========================

The script should always be started as an unprivileged user (ie "sudo -u www-data ./iiBot")

Spam protection is provided by LOCKOUT_TIME; the minimum time between commands in seconds. 

The LOCKOUT_TIME value is also used to avoid having 2 channels both try to start the ii
server at the same time. For this reason please set LOCKOUT_TIME to a unique value for each
channel!

Everything except this file should have execute permissions for the user that will be 
running the server. The scripts/user and tmp folders should also have write permission.

When starting the script, you may see a few lines of "Kill: No such process". This is not a 
problem, and you can safely ignore these messages.

The script will work in init.d and supports the following syntax:
	"./iiBot stop" 		Will end all configured bot scripts & ii servers
	"./iiBot restart" 	Will restart all configured bot scripts & ii servers
	"./iiBot" 		Will start any ii servers not started, then stop & start all
				configured bot scripts

If ii is hung and not connected to a server, you can kill the ii server process ("killall ii") 
and the script will automatically restart it


Dependencies: bash php5-cli ruby python tcl8.4 psmisc(killall)
